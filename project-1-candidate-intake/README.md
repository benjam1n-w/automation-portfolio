# Automated Candidate Intake Pipeline

## Problem

Vendor emails containing candidate information had to be manually reviewed and copied into Excel. This process was time-consuming and prone to human error.

## Goal

Automate extraction of candidate data from vendor emails and store it in Excel without manual intervention.

## Solution

I built a Power Automate workflow that:

- Detects incoming vendor emails automatically
- Extracts structured candidate information from email content
- Transfers the data directly into an Excel spreadsheet
- Standardizes the data entry format
- Eliminates the need for manual copying

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Power Automate
- Outlook email connectors
- Excel Online

## Impact

- Reduced manual data entry time
- Improved consistency of candidate records
- Minimized risk of human error
- Streamlined vendor communication workflow
